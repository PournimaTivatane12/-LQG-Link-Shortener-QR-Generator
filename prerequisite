 Frontend Development:

ðŸ‘‰ Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ‘‰ Experience with frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, or Vanilla JavaScript.

 Backend Development:

ðŸ‘‰ Python frameworks like Flask or Django, or Node.js with Express.js.

ðŸ‘‰ Understanding of RESTful API design and implementation.

 Database Knowledge:

ðŸ‘‰ Basics of working with databases like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.

 QR Code Generation:

ðŸ‘‰ Familiarity with libraries for generating QR codes (qrcode for Python or qr-code-generator for JavaScript).

 API Integration:

ðŸ‘‰ Basic understanding of building and consuming APIs.

 URL Shortening Algorithm:

ðŸ‘‰ Understanding of encoding algorithms like Base62 for generating short URLs.

2. Software/Development Tools:

 Code Editor/IDE:

ðŸ‘‰ Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any preferred code editor.

 Version Control:

ðŸ‘‰ Git and GitHub (for managing code and version control).

ðŸ‘‰ GitHub repository setup for tracking project progress (or another version control platform).

 Environment Setup:

ðŸ‘‰ Python 3.x installed on your system if using Python for the backend.

ðŸ‘‰ Node.js and npm if using JavaScript/Node.js for the backend.

 Package Managers:

ðŸ‘‰ pip for Python or npm for Node.js to manage project dependencies.

3. Required Libraries/Packages:

 Frontend:

ðŸ‘‰ Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ‘‰ React or Vue.js if building a more interactive frontend.

 Backend:

ðŸ‘‰ Python (Flask/Django):

ðŸ‘‰ Flask or Django for handling requests and routing.

ðŸ‘‰ qrcode for generating QR codes.

ðŸ‘‰ hashids or similar library for generating short URLs.

 Node.js:

ðŸ‘‰ express for handling backend routes.

ðŸ‘‰ qr-image or qrcode for generating QR codes.

ðŸ‘‰ shortid or nano-id for generating shortened URLs.

 Database:

ðŸ‘‰ Install a database management system like:

ðŸ‘‰ MongoDB (pymongo for Python, mongoose for Node.js).

ðŸ‘‰ MySQL/PostgreSQL (sqlalchemy for Python, pg or mysql for Node.js).

 API Testing Tools:

ðŸ‘‰Postman or cURL for testing API endpoints.

4. Cloud and Deployment Knowledge:

 Cloud Services:

ðŸ‘‰Basic knowledge of deploying web apps on platforms like:

ðŸ‘‰ AWS (EC2, Lambda, or other cloud services).

ðŸ‘‰ Glitch or Cyclic (for simpler, cost-effective deployment).

 CI/CD Pipeline (Optional):

ðŸ‘‰ If deploying on AWS or other platforms, understanding of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) would be useful.

ðŸ‘‰ Tools like AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.

5. Security and Optimization:

ðŸ‘‰ Understanding how to enforce HTTPS and secure communication.

ðŸ‘‰ Input validation techniques to avoid issues like malicious URLs.

ðŸ‘‰ Optional: rate-limiting techniques to prevent service abuse.

6. Additional Tools (Optional):

ðŸ‘‰ Docker: For containerizing the application, if required for easier deployment and scalability.

ðŸ‘‰ Nginx: As a load balancer or reverse proxy (if not using serverless).

ðŸ‘‰ Google Analytics or other analytics tools: For tracking the usage of shortened links.

ðŸ‘‰ These prerequisites will provide you with the foundational tools and knowledge to develop, manage, and deploy the LQG-Link-Shortener-QR-Generator project effectively.

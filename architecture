1. Frontend:

Framework/Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js for SPA).

Purpose:

Users can input long URLs for shortening.
Users can choose to generate a QR code for the shortened URL.
Displays the shortened URL and corresponding QR code.

2. Backend:

Framework/Language: Python (Flask, Django) or Node.js (Express.js).
Purpose:

Receive the long URL from the frontend.
Generate a unique shortened URL.
Generate a QR code using a library like qrcode in Python or qr-code-generator in Node.js.
Store and retrieve the shortened URL and QR code from the database.

3. Database:

Type: NoSQL or SQL database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).

Purpose:

Store the original URLs, shortened URLs, and associated metadata (e.g., date created, usage count).
Store QR codes (as images or encoded strings).

4. API Layer:

Purpose:

Handle requests for shortening URLs and generating QR codes.
Handle URL redirection when the shortened link is accessed.
Serve QR codes to the frontend when requested.

5. URL Shortening Algorithm:

Use hashing (e.g., Base62) to generate a unique short key for each URL.
Ensure that the generated key is unique by checking against the database.

6. QR Code Generation:

Use a QR code generation library to create a QR code for each shortened URL.
Return the QR code in an appropriate format (image or base64 encoded) to the frontend.

7. Deployment:

Cloud Provider: AWS (consider a free tier service like Lambda or EC2 with care for costs), Glitch, or Cyclic.
Load Balancer: If using a scalable platform, AWS ELB or Nginx can be used to manage traffic.
Serverless Option: AWS Lambda can be used for a serverless architecture to handle link shortening and QR generation requests.

8. Monitoring and Analytics:

Track the usage of shortened links (e.g., number of clicks, user analytics) using a service like Google Analytics or custom monitoring.
Use logging and monitoring tools (CloudWatch or custom logs) to observe system performance.

9. Security:

Input validation to prevent malicious URLs.
Optionally implement a rate limiter to prevent abuse of the service.
HTTPS should be enforced for secure communication.

Diagram of the Architecture:

1.Frontend (Web App)
  URL → Request to Backend → Show Shortened URL & QR Code

2.Backend
 Receives URL → Shorten URL & Store in Database → Return Shortened URL & QR Code

3.Database
 Store Original URL, Shortened URL, QR Code Image/Info

4.Deployment
 Serve the frontend and backend using a platform like AWS, Glitch, or Cyclic.


This architecture allows for scalability and separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and database components.
